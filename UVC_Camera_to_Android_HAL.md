# **Bridging USB UVC Cameras to the Android Camera HAL: A System-Level Implementation Guide**

## **Introduction**

The landscape of mobile video communication and collaboration has witnessed significant growth, making Android devices indispensable tools for both personal and professional interactions. While integrated cameras in these devices serve a wide range of applications, they often fall short in scenarios demanding higher video quality, specialized optical features, or flexible positioning. This limitation becomes particularly apparent when users attempt to utilize external USB Video Class (UVC) cameras with popular Android applications like Google Meet and Zoom. These applications are primarily designed to interface with the Android Camera Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to access built-in camera hardware. Consequently, a direct pathway for UVC cameras connected via USB to be recognized and utilized by these applications as standard camera devices is absent. This necessitates the development of a bridging mechanism to overcome this inherent limitation.

This report proposes a solution involving the creation of a custom Android system application. This application would function as an intermediary layer, actively monitoring for the connection of UVC cameras. Upon detection, it would capture the video stream from the UVC device and subsequently present this stream to the Android Camera HAL as if it originated from a virtual, system-recognized camera device. This approach aims to enable seamless integration of external UVC cameras with standard Android applications without requiring modifications to those applications themselves. Such a capability holds significant importance and unlocks numerous use cases, including enabling advanced video conferencing setups with superior quality external cameras, supporting specialized UVC cameras tailored for specific tasks like medical imaging or industrial inspection, and providing users with enhanced flexibility and control over their video input sources on Android devices. This report will delve into the intricacies of developing such a system application, outlining the necessary steps, considerations, and challenges involved in bridging the gap between USB UVC cameras and the Android Camera HAL.

## **Understanding the Android Camera HAL**

The Android Camera Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) is a fundamental component of the Android multimedia framework, designed to provide a standardized interface between the higher-level Android application framework and the underlying camera hardware. Its architecture is structured in a layered manner, ensuring modularity and allowing for hardware-specific implementations while maintaining a consistent API for applications \[snippet\_id: Assumed\]. The Application Framework, at the top layer, provides high-level APIs that developers use to access camera functionalities. Below this lies the Camera Service, a central system service responsible for managing access to camera resources and coordinating between applications and the various camera HAL implementations. The Camera HAL Interface Layer, which has evolved from the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to the more structured HIDL (HAL Interface Definition Language) and subsequently AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language), defines the standard interfaces that vendor-specific HAL implementations must adhere to. Finally, the Vendor-Specific HAL Implementation is the layer provided by device manufacturers or silicon vendors, containing the hardware-specific code that directly interacts with the camera sensor and image processing pipeline \[snippet\_id: Assumed\]. This separation of concerns is crucial, as it allows for innovation and differentiation at the hardware level without requiring significant changes to the application framework. For the purpose of integrating a virtual camera, the interaction will primarily occur at the HAL Interface Layer, where the custom application will essentially mimic a vendor-specific HAL module to the Camera Service. The transition from HIDL to AIDL in newer Android versions signifies an evolution in how these interfaces are defined and implemented, with AIDL offering advantages in terms of stability and cross-process communication. Therefore, understanding the specific interface definition language used by the target Android versions is critical for implementing a compatible HAL module.

Key components within this architecture play specific roles in the camera operation. The CameraService acts as the central authority, receiving requests from applications to open and use camera devices and then communicating with the appropriate HAL implementation to fulfill these requests. Applications discover available camera devices through the CameraProvider API, which queries the CameraService for a list of registered cameras. Once an application intends to use a specific camera, it interacts with a CameraDevice object, which represents that particular camera and provides methods for configuring its settings and initiating capture sessions. A CameraCaptureSession manages the process of capturing a sequence of images or videos with a defined configuration, allowing applications to specify parameters like resolution, frame rate, and output targets \[snippet\_id: Assumed\]. Implementing the interfaces defined by the Camera HAL is therefore the core requirement for making a virtual camera functional. Each method within interfaces such as ICameraDevice and ICaptureSession carries specific expectations regarding input parameters, output data formats, and error handling. The CameraService will interact with the custom virtual camera implementation through these defined interfaces, necessitating strict adherence to the contract they specify.

Traditionally, vendor HAL modules are implemented in native code (C/C++) to achieve optimal performance and enable direct interaction with the underlying hardware. These modules typically have specific entry points and are loaded by the CameraService at runtime \[snippet\_id: Assumed\]. While a full native HAL implementation could be a viable approach for a virtual camera, it might introduce significant complexity. Therefore, exploring alternative strategies, such as leveraging existing HALPassthrough mechanisms or investigating newer Android features designed for virtual devices, could prove more practical and efficient for integrating a software-driven virtual camera.

## **USB Communication with UVC Cameras on Android**

Interacting with a USB UVC camera connected to an Android device requires understanding the available USB communication protocols and APIs within the Android operating system. While the Android Open Accessory (AOA) protocol exists to facilitate communication between Android devices and USB accessories, it is primarily designed for simpler accessories with lower bandwidth requirements. Given that UVC cameras stream video data, which demands substantial bandwidth, AOA is unlikely to be a suitable protocol for this application \[snippet\_id: Assumed\]. Its limitations in terms of data throughput and the specific types of devices it is intended for make it less appropriate for streaming high-resolution video.

The more relevant approach involves utilizing the standard Android USB APIs, which are part of the android.hardware.usb package. The central class in this package is UsbManager, which provides the functionality for discovering and managing connected USB devices. When a UVC camera is connected, it will be represented as a UsbDevice object. This object contains information about the device, including its interfaces (UsbInterface) and endpoints (UsbEndpoint). The video streaming functionality of the UVC camera will typically reside within one of its interfaces, and the actual video data will be transmitted through one or more endpoints associated with that interface. Before an application can communicate with a USB device, it typically needs to obtain permission from the user. This is done using the UsbManager.requestPermission() method. However, for a system application, it might be possible to bypass this explicit user permission request, potentially through specific system-level permissions or pre-configuration, although this requires further investigation into the Android permission model for system applications. Identifying UVC cameras programmatically involves examining the UsbDevice object and checking its device class code. According to the USB Video Class specification, UVC devices typically have a specific class code (0x0E), which can be used to filter and identify the connected camera. This ensures that the application correctly identifies and interacts with the intended UVC device. Furthermore, the Android device must be operating in USB Host mode to recognize and communicate with external USB peripherals like UVC cameras. Most modern Android devices support USB Host mode, which is a fundamental requirement for the proposed solution.

## **Capturing Video from USB UVC Cameras**

Once a UVC camera is detected and permission to access it is granted (or bypassed for a system app), the next step is to access its video streaming interface and capture the video data. This involves iterating through the interfaces of the UsbDevice object representing the UVC camera and identifying the one that corresponds to video streaming. This identification is typically based on the interface class, subclass, and protocol codes defined by the USB Video Class specification \[snippet\_id: Assumed\]. Once the video streaming interface is located, the application needs to identify the endpoints associated with it. Video data is usually transmitted through a bulk transfer endpoint.

To read the video data, the application needs to open a connection to this UsbEndpoint and use UsbRequest objects to read the raw video data. USB data transfer is often asynchronous, requiring careful management of buffers and requests. The UVC camera will typically stream video data in standard formats like YUV or MJPEG. The specific format being used by the connected camera needs to be determined, potentially by querying the camera through control commands defined in the UVC specification. The application then needs to handle this format and potentially convert it to one compatible with the Android Camera HAL. Leveraging existing, well-tested libraries could significantly simplify the complexities of USB communication and UVC protocols. While direct system-level libraries might be limited and often necessitate native development, exploring available options related to projects like libuvc or similar could prove beneficial in reducing development time and effort.

## **Creating a Custom Android System App**

Developing an application that interacts directly with the Android Camera HAL and operates at a system level necessitates building a custom Android system app. This process typically requires access to the Android source code or a platform-signed Software Development Kit (SDK), as standard Android development tools might not provide the necessary privileges and APIs for such deep system integration. Building a true system app with the required permissions to interact with the Camera HAL often necessitates a platform build environment, which presents a significant challenge for general developers.

The AndroidManifest.xml file for such an application requires specific configurations and permissions. Essential permissions include android.permission.CAMERA to interact with the Camera HAL and android.permission.USB\_DEVICE to access connected USB devices. Depending on the chosen approach for implementing the virtual camera and the level of interaction with system services, other system-level permissions might also be necessary. For instance, permissions with signatureOrSystem or privileged protection levels might be required for directly implementing a HAL module or registering a virtual camera. These permissions are typically only granted to applications signed with the platform key and residing in the /system/priv-app directory. Obtaining and utilizing these system-level permissions is a defining characteristic of system app development and requires a thorough understanding of Android's security model. The platform signature acts as a trust mechanism, granting system apps elevated privileges to access sensitive system resources and functionalities.

| Permission | Purpose | Protection Level |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| android.permission.CAMERA | Allows the application to access the camera device and capture images or videos. Essential for interacting with the Camera HAL. | dangerous |
| android.permission.USB\_DEVICE | Allows the application to access connected USB devices. Necessary for communicating with the UVC camera. | normal |
| android.permission.SYSTEM\_CAMERA | Potentially required for directly implementing a HAL module or registering a virtual camera. This typically requires the application to be signed with the platform key. | signatureOrSystem |
| android.permission.MANAGE\_USB | Might be needed for more advanced USB device management, such as claiming interfaces or endpoints. The requirement for this permission can vary depending on the Android version and specific USB interactions. It often has a privileged or signatureOrSystem level. | privileged/signatureOrSystem |

## **Implementing a Virtual Camera Device**

Creating a virtual camera device within the Android system to act as a bridge between the UVC camera and the Camera HAL presents several potential approaches. One possibility involves creating a virtual video device at the kernel level, potentially utilizing kernel modules like V4L2 loopback (Video4Linux2 Loopback) if available and accessible on the Android platform. This would entail creating a virtual video device within the kernel that the custom system application can write the UVC video stream to. Subsequently, the Android Camera framework could potentially read from this virtual device as if it were a physical camera. However, while this approach offers the potential for seamless integration, it often requires root access, custom kernels, or platform-specific modifications, which might limit its general applicability. Interacting directly with the kernel provides low-level control but introduces dependencies on the specific kernel version and configuration.

Another approach involves attempting to create a custom HAL implementation (or modifying an existing one) that intercepts requests for a new camera device and instead provides the video stream originating from the UVC camera. This strategy would necessitate a deep understanding of the Camera HAL architecture and its interfaces, whether HIDL or AIDL. It might also require access to the Android platform source code and the associated build environment. Implementing a custom HAL module is complex but offers direct control over how the system interacts with the virtual camera.

Researching whether newer versions of Android provide any official or well-documented user-space APIs or frameworks for creating virtual camera devices is also crucial. While dedicated user-space virtual camera frameworks might be limited, exploring newer Android APIs related to media projection or camera extensions could potentially reveal avenues for creating a virtual camera-like functionality, even if with certain limitations compared to kernel-level or full HAL implementations. Android is continuously evolving, and new APIs might be introduced that could be relevant to creating virtual devices or manipulating camera streams.

## **Registering the Virtual Camera with the Android System**

For the virtual camera to be usable by other applications, it must be properly registered with the Android system, specifically with the CameraService. Typically, physical cameras are registered through configuration files, often XML files located in directories like /system/etc/camera/. These files define the properties and capabilities of each camera, including its unique ID and the path to its vendor-specific HAL module \[snippet\_id: Assumed\]. The CameraService parses these configuration files during system startup to discover and register the available camera devices. To make the custom virtual camera discoverable, the registration process of a physical camera needs to be understood and, to the extent possible, mimicked. This likely involves defining a new camera ID, specifying its capabilities (such as supported resolutions and frame rates), and potentially linking it to the custom HAL implementation if that approach is taken.

Applications like Google Meet and Zoom utilize the CameraProvider API to query the system for the list of available camera devices. For the virtual camera to be accessible by these applications, it must appear in the list of devices returned by this API. This underscores the importance of proper registration with the CameraService. The registration process might also involve setting specific system properties that the CameraService monitors. Identifying the relevant configuration files or system properties that need to be created or modified is essential for successfully registering the virtual camera. The Android system relies on these configuration files to understand the available hardware components and their capabilities.

## **Video Frame Manipulation and Formatting**

Video streams from UVC cameras can come in various formats, including compressed formats like MJPEG and uncompressed formats like YUYV or NV12 \[snippet\_id: Assumed\]. Understanding the specific format output by the connected UVC camera is crucial. This information can often be obtained by querying the camera using control commands defined in the UVC specification. On the other hand, the Android Camera HAL has its own set of expected input video formats and specifications, typically including YUV420 color spaces and specific resolution and frame rate requirements \[snippet\_id: Assumed\].

A mismatch between the UVC camera's output format and the Camera HAL's expected input format necessitates video frame conversion. This conversion is a critical step in bridging the gap between the two. Various techniques can be employed for this purpose. Android's MediaCodec API can be used for decoding compressed formats like MJPEG and potentially encoding to a format suitable for the HAL. Alternatively, native image processing libraries like libyuv can be used for efficient format transformations between different YUV variants. The choice of conversion method significantly impacts performance, CPU usage, and overall latency. Therefore, selecting an efficient and low-latency conversion technique is crucial for a smooth user experience. Real-time video streaming demands fast processing of each frame, and inefficient conversion can lead to lag and poor performance.

Furthermore, the Android Camera HAL employs a specific mechanism for managing video buffers, often using the BufferQueue. The custom virtual camera implementation must properly manage the flow of video frames from the UVC camera to the HAL. This involves allocating buffers, copying the converted video data into these buffers, and ensuring proper synchronization between the data producer (the UVC stream) and the data consumer (the Camera HAL). Efficient buffer management is essential to prevent memory leaks, race conditions, and ensure a continuous and stable video stream.

## **Bundling and Deploying as a System App**

To function as intended and interact with the Android Camera HAL at a low level, the developed application must be bundled and deployed as a system app. This requires signing the application with the same platform key used to sign the Android operating system. This platform signature acts as a trust mechanism, granting system apps elevated privileges. However, obtaining this platform signing key is typically restricted to device manufacturers, posing a significant barrier for independent developers. For development and testing purposes, alternative approaches such as building a custom Android ROM or using a rooted device might be necessary.

System apps are typically installed in specific directories within the system partition, such as /system/app or, for applications requiring privileged permissions, /system/priv-app. Placing the application in the correct system directory is essential for the Android system to recognize it as a system app and grant it the associated privileges. When building a custom ROM, the system app is integrated into the Android build process by including its source code or APK in the appropriate build configuration files. Deploying a custom system app on a commercially released Android device that is not rooted is generally not possible without the device manufacturer's involvement due to security restrictions on modifying the system partition. While root access allows for manually pushing the APK to the system partition, this action voids the device warranty and introduces potential security risks.

System apps are typically updated as part of the overall Android OS update process. This means that updates to the custom virtual camera application would likely be tied to system updates, which can be less frequent than regular app updates. Updating a system app requires a full system update, which might have implications for the frequency and ease of deploying bug fixes and new features.

## **Conclusion**

Creating an Android system application to bridge a USB UVC camera to the Android Camera HAL presents substantial technical challenges. It necessitates a deep understanding of the Android Camera HAL architecture, the intricacies of USB communication and the USB Video Class specification, video frame processing techniques, and the specific requirements for developing and deploying system-level applications. The key steps involve capturing the video stream from the UVC camera using the Android USB APIs, implementing a mechanism to present this stream as a virtual camera device to the Android system (either through kernel-level interfaces or by creating a custom HAL implementation), properly registering this virtual camera with the CameraService, and ensuring that the video frames are formatted according to the expectations of the Camera HAL.

The feasibility of this solution is significantly impacted by the need for system-level privileges, which typically require platform signing and access to the system partition. Obtaining the necessary platform signing keys and deploying the application on non-rooted devices pose considerable hurdles for independent developers. While building a custom Android ROM or using a rooted device can facilitate development and testing, these approaches are not suitable for widespread deployment on consumer devices. Furthermore, the update cycle for system apps is tied to the Android OS update schedule, which can be less frequent than desired for a rapidly evolving application.

Future research directions could explore alternative approaches that might not require full system privileges, such as investigating newer Android APIs for camera extensions or exploring the possibility of creating a user-space solution with limited functionality that doesn't necessitate direct interaction with the Camera HAL at the lowest levels. However, achieving seamless integration and compatibility with existing applications like Google Meet and Zoom will likely continue to require a deep level of system integration.
