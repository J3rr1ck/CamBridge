                 This often aligns with the HAL module ID if it's not "camera".
                 If your camera.uvc.so is named to be loaded by a generic "external" provider service,
                 the instance name might be different (e.g. "external/0").
                 For a direct named service, "uvc" or a similar unique name is used.
